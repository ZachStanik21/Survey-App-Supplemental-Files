# Survey-App-Supplemental-Files
Supplemental files for a web-based survey app developed for the Yale School of Public Health.

These supplemental files include the files developed for the minor backend operations required by the study. Included are the following:

• A modified version of the data collector, written in Perl, originally included with the Experience Sampler app.

• A second data collector to handle storing the GPS data collected in the initial period of the study.

• The JavaScript and HTML files developed for creating a Google Map to display the participant's important locations, using the GPS data collected in the initial period of the study.
